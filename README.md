# __Journee__

Journee is a platform that gives you the freedom to journal the important parts of your life, either just for you or for others. It’s a great way to capture a single page for that day along with a photo and self-image if you wish. You then have a chronological history of all the things you want to look back on in years to come. It’s a great way to stay connected with your journey through life and share it with others!

## Features

### User Account Creation

### View Count

* Each journal entry has functionality to track how many views it has had.
* This allows a user to know how many others viewed their public journal page.
* The count is also used in picking content for the showcase page.
* The logic delibrately counts every single view to allow for a simulated production expereince during testing and review.
* With a launched site this functionality would be modified to use something like Django-Hitcount so that only unique views per IP would be counted

## Testing

## Technoligies & Tools

* Bootstrap 5.3
